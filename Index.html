<p>...i needed a little piece of real estate for some projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CURRENT PROJECTS:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: #ccffcc;">Raspberry Pi 3B+</span> (currently running Kali Linux) w/custom 3D printed case (shoutout to local library - thank youuu) // bought not 1 but now 2 tiny monitors from my techno-anarchist electrical-engineer neighbor.&nbsp; i'll post pictures of everything soon.&nbsp; not that anyone sees this site but more for my journal to remember.&nbsp; set up also includes cheapo AR9271 wifi adapter (you know what's up), hardwired keyboard and mouse with bluetooth versions as a redundancy.&nbsp; ALL GOING INTO THE TRAVELING WARBOX ;] (see last bullet point)</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; USB Army Knife (Lilygo T-Dongle) discovering and inventing in the new world of this piece of hacketry.&nbsp; it is very cool.&nbsp; this is an ESP32S3 with custom firmware by i-am-shodan that has quite a suite of pentest/security tools.&nbsp; these include but are not limited to remote access (via wifi to execute commands, or even more thoughly,deploying an agent ahead of time on a target device --typically windows only -- and accessing it via VNC at a later date), the typical marauder framework (developed by just.call.me.koko) for SSID spoofing/Deauthentication Attacks/Rogue APs, BadUSB/RubberDucky abilities, et. al. [apparently, there's even a way to access locked devices.&nbsp; the great thing is it is, of course, open-source and therefore will expand into even cooler shit until it is inevitably banned or at least difficult for the average person to get their hands on one.&nbsp; oh, and it has a tiny display that you can play images on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Alfa AWUS036AXML My brand new beautiful wireless adapter.&nbsp; god damn, it's so pretty.&nbsp; it's 2.4/5 AND 6ghz first of all.&nbsp; it's range and speed tests are regularly at the top of evaluation lists.&nbsp; it has usb c.&nbsp; but of course, the real beauty of it is monitor mode and packet injection is a given.&nbsp; it's an investment towards my future.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Bluetooth/WiFi/RC Jammer I'll be building my first "hardware hacking" project from the ground up.&nbsp; just ordered all the parts from china mostly so they should be year by next year -__-.&nbsp; as you may know or can probably gauge from the name, it will in fact have the ability to jam those signals for up to a reported 20 meter radius.&nbsp; EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; WARBOX This bad larry is essentially a cheap footlocker that holds many of my tech bits and bobs for on the move.&nbsp; however, while it obstensibly exists to transport my computer hardware and tech-phreaking gear, it also contains a Raspberry Pi set up with two portible tiny monitors, keyboard, mouse, and wifi adapter capable of monitor mode/packet injection.&nbsp; It has multiple small brand-name power banks for temporary power, wired power plug interface for when access avails itself, and currently building a humungous homemade power bank of 18650 and other type lithium ion batteries.&nbsp; this thing will go for a long time.&nbsp; i installed some chain so the lid stays open, attached some metak plumber strapping to hold things, insulated it with loads of protective foam, and it has stickers.&nbsp; good ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll add pictures later in the week.</p>
