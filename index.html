        <p>...i needed a little piece of real estate for some projects.</p>

        <p><strong>CURRENT PROJECTS:</strong></p>
        
        <p>1. <span style="color: #ccffcc;">Raspberry Pi 3B+</span> (currently running Kali Linux) w/custom 3D printed case (shoutout to local library - thank youuu) // bought not 1 but now 2 tiny monitors from my techno-anarchist electrical-engineer neighbor. i'll post pictures of everything soon. not that anyone sees this site but more for my journal to remember. set up also includes cheapo AR9271 wifi adapter (you know what's up), hardwired keyboard and mouse with bluetooth versions as a redundancy. ALL GOING INTO THE TRAVELING WARBOX ;] (see last bullet point)</p>
        
        <p>2. USB Army Knife (Lilygo T-Dongle) discovering and inventing in the new world of this piece of hacketry. it is very cool. this is an ESP32S3 with custom firmware by i-am-shodan that has quite a suite of pentest/security tools. these include but are not limited to remote access (via wifi to execute commands, or even more thoroughly, deploying an agent ahead of time on a target device --typically windows only -- and accessing it via VNC at a later date), the typical marauder framework (developed by just.call.me.koko) for SSID spoofing/Deauthentication Attacks/Rogue APs, BadUSB/RubberDucky abilities, et. al. [apparently, there's even a way to access locked devices. the great thing is it is, of course, open-source and therefore will expand into even cooler shit until it is inevitably banned or at least difficult for the average person to get their hands on one. oh, and it has a tiny display that you can play images on.]</p>
        
        <p>3. Alfa AWUS036AXML My brand new beautiful wireless adapter. god damn, it's so pretty. it's 2.4/5 AND 6ghz first of all. it's range and speed tests are regularly at the top of evaluation lists. it has usb c. but of course, the real beauty of it is monitor mode and packet injection is a given. it's an investment towards my future.</p>
        
        <p>4. Bluetooth/WiFi/RC Jammer I'll be building my first "hardware hacking" project from the ground up. just ordered all the parts from china mostly so they should be here by next year -__-. as you may know or can probably gauge from the name, it will in fact have the ability to jam those signals for up to a reported 20 meter radius. EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY</p>
        
        <p>5. WARBOX This bad larry is essentially a cheap footlocker that holds many of my tech bits and bobs for on the move. however, while it ostensibly exists to transport my computer hardware and tech-phreaking gear, it also contains a Raspberry Pi set up with two portable tiny monitors, keyboard, mouse, and wifi adapter capable of monitor mode/packet injection. It has multiple small brand-name power banks for temporary power, wired power plug interface for when access avails itself, and currently building a humungous homemade power bank of 18650 and other type lithium-ion batteries. this thing will go for a long time. i installed some chain so the lid stays open, attached some metal plumber strapping to hold things, insulated it with loads of protective foam, and it has stickers. good ones.</p>
        
        <p>I'll add pictures later in the week.</p>
